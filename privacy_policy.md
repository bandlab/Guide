##Chew Privacy Policy
Last Updated: March 2015

Chew understands that privacy is important. This Privacy Policy applies to any and all services, applications, platforms, websites, or other affiliated ventures offered by Chew and sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.  

Chew Live Ltd (“Chew”, “us”, “we” and “our”) offers the Chew Service and we are the data controller of the personal data you provide to us or we have access to. Chew Live Ltd is a limited liability company. We are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales with registered number 09260256 and our registered address is 86-90 Paul Street, London, EC2A 4NE.

By using the Chew Service, you are expressly accepting and consenting to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Chew Service [Terms of Use](http://chew.tv/guide/terms/general). Your use of the Chew Service and any personal information you provide through the Chew Service are subject at all times to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use. Defined terms used in this Privacy Policy and not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meanings given to them in the Terms of Use.

The Chew Service may include and link to features and services (such as social applications like Twitter and Facebook) that are provided by a third party. If you use these features and services, please understand that the third parties that operate them may collect information from you which will be used in accordance with their own privacy policy and terms of use, which may differ from ours. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies or for any personal data that may be collected through these websites or services. You should always read the privacy policy of any feature or service you access carefully in order to understand the specific privacy and information usage practices.

### 1. The Information Chew Collects: 

**Information You Provide**

You may provide to Chew what is generally called "personally identifiable" information (such as your name, email address, photograph, video footage of you, credit card number, postal mailing address, and telephone numbers) if you use certain services or products from the Chew Service, or otherwise use the features and functionality of the Chew Service. 

To access certain functions of the Chew Service, you may need to register with us via your valid Facebook account or Twitter account. We may receive further personally identifiable information from Facebook or Twitter when you link your Facebook or Twitter account to your Chew account, such as your name, gender, locale, and other information in your public profile. You can manage the disclosure of this information through your Facebook or Twitter account. You agree to comply with all Facebook and Twitter terms of use and privacy policies when accessing Chew through your Facebook or Twitter account.

You may give us information about you by filling in forms on the Chew Service or by corresponding with us. This includes information you provide when you register to use the Chew Service, subscribe to the Chew Service, upload or share Produced Content, access and view other Produced Content or other Material on the Chew Service and when you report a problem with the Chew Service.

Please note that we are not responsible for the information you share with others when using the Chew Service or uploading Produced Content. Remember that the Chew Service is a publicly-accessible platform and so do not upload or share any information about yourself which you do not want to be publicly accessible. 

When you upload or share Produced Content that features or includes another person, or when you provide information about other people, you are solely responsible for obtaining their prior consent for you to do so and for telling them that we may use such content and any personal information about them which you provide in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
"Automatically Collected" Information: When you access the Chew Service (including through your computer or your mobile device) or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology. This "automatically collected" information may include Internet Protocol address ("IP Address"), a unique user ID, version of software installed, system type, the content and pages that you access on the Chew Service, and the dates and times that you visit the Chew Service.

### Information We Receive From Other Sources

We are also working closely with third parties (including, for example, business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers and search information providers) and may receive information about you from them.

**"Cookies" Information**

When you access the Chew Service, we may send one or more cookies (small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters) to your computer. Our Service uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our Service. Cookies do this by storing information about your preferences on your device, including the device model, manufacturer, screen resolution, device capabilities, service provider, country and city location data. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you use and interact with our Service and also allows us to improve the Service. By using our Chew Service you accept the use of cookies in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Chew may use both session cookies and persistent cookies.  

A session cookie disappears after you close your browser.  A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Chew Service.  Persistent cookies can be removed.  Please review your web browser "Help" file to learn the best way to modify your cookie settings.

**"Pixel Tags" or "Clear Gifs"**

A pixel tag, also known as a clear GIF or web beacon, is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of our Chew Service but not on your computer.  When you access these pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of that visit.  They usually work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular computer visits a particular page.  If you turn off cookies the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous website visit.

**Your User ID**

Your User ID is displayed throughout the Chew Service and is therefore available to the public.  Therefore, if you associate your actual name with your User ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your activities on the Chew Service.

### 2. The Way Chew Uses Information:

Chew uses the information that you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on the Chew Service - as well as to track user-generated content and users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with applicable laws. We also use your information in order to validate you as a registered user, tell you about changes to the services we provide or changes to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, to deliver the Chew Service to you, to allow you to upload, share, stream and store Produced Content, to moderate your account and your Produced Content, to detect and prevent criminal or infringing activity, and to comply with applicable laws. 

We may use your email address or mobile number, without further consent, for administrative communications such as notifying you of Chew Service updates, for customer service purposes, and to send privacy or security related notices.

Chew uses all of the information that we collect to understand the usage trends and preferences of our users, to improve the way the Chew Service works and looks and to create new features and functionality.
Chew may use automatically collected information and cookie information to: (a) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you access the Chew Service; (b) provide customised third-party advertisements, content and information; (c) monitor and report on the effectiveness of third-party marketing campaigns; (d) monitor and report aggregate usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages accessed; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.

We will not keep your personal information for longer than necessary for our operational purposes or for compliance with applicable laws.

### 3. When Chew Discloses Information:

Chew does not share your personally identifiable information with other organisations for their marketing or promotional uses without your prior express consent.  Please be aware, however, that any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to display on any publicly available portion of the Chew Service - such as when you publish your public profile information - becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others without restriction.

Chew may disclose automatically collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage data, referring/ exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to assist those parties in understanding the usage and demographic patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, or other functionality on the Chew Service.

We may disclose some limited user information to affiliated companies or other businesses or persons to: provide website hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfill orders; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality; and assist Chew in improving the Chew Service and creating new services features.  We contractually require that these parties process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy, we authorise only a limited use of such information, and we require these parties to use reasonable confidentiality measures.

Chew may disclose user information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with laws (such as copyright or trade mark law) or respond to a court order, or warrant in the manner required by the requesting entity.

Chew also reserves the right to disclose user information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; enforce our Terms of Use; protect Chew from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Chew Service; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Chew, our Users, or others.

### 4. Your Choices and Access to your Personal Information

You may, of course, decline to share your personally-identifiable information with Chew, in which case Chew will not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality found on the Chew Service.  You may view, update, correct, or delete your user information and preferences by contacting us at support@chew.tv.

To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your information.  You, as a user of the Chew Service, are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique user password and account information at all times.

Please take care when uploading, streaming or storing Produced Content which contains or includes sensitive information about you. If you upload this information to the Chew Service then you understand and accept that we may process this information and make it available to other Users via the Chew Service in accordance with the functionality of the Chew Service. We are not responsible for the information you choose to share with others via the Chew Service.

### 5. Advertisers

Chew allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Chew Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks may use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements that appear within the Chew Service and they automatically receive your IP Address and other log file information when this happens. Such third-party ad servers may also use other technologies (such as cookies, javascript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalise their advertising content.

Chew does not provide your personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Chew to show an advertisement to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience that they were trying to reach.

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. Chew reserves the right the add or remove third-party ad networks or ad servers in its discretion and Chew may not at all times list such updated ad network or ad server partners in this Privacy Policy.

### 6. Our Commitment to Data Security:

Chew uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Chew, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Chew makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If Chew learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Chew may post a notice on the Chew Service if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach, you should notify us at support@chew.tv.

### 7. Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy:
Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Chew does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under 13 years of age. If Chew learns that personally identifiable information of persons less than 13 years of age has been collected on or through the Chew Service, then Chew will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.

If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a Chew Service member, then please contact Chew at support@chew.tv to have that child’s account terminated and information deleted.

### 8. Transfer of Data:

For users visiting the Chew Service from outside the European Economic Area (“**EEA**”), please note that any data you enter into, upload to, make available or share via the Chew Service will be transferred into, and stored within, a destination within the EEA for use by Chew and its affiliates for any of the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. In addition, because Chew operates globally, we may make information we gather available to worldwide business units and affiliates. By providing any data on the Chew Service, you hereby expressly consent to such transfers of your data to the United Kingdom or other countries.

For users using the Chew Service from within the EEA, you understand and accept that the data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the EEA. It may also be processed by our service providers and staff operating outside the EEA. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing outside of the EEA. 

Not all countries provide the same level of data protection as the United Kingdom. However, we do take steps to put in place arrangements with our service providers outside of the United Kingdom to ensure that your personal information is protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### 9. In the Event of Merger or Sale:

In the event that Chew is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.

### 10. Third Parties

Except as otherwise expressly provided otherwise, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you or that you disclose to us. If you disclose your information to others besides Chew, whether they are users of the Chew Service or on other sites or services, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them.  Chew does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.

### 11. Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy:

This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically without further notice to you and this will be reflected by the "LAST UPDATED" date found at the top of this page. Please revisit this page to stay aware of any changes. In general, we only use your personal information in the manner described in the Privacy Policy in effect when we received that personal information. Your continued use of the Chew Service constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any future revisions.

For revisions to this Privacy Policy that may be materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of personal information you have provided to us, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you and obtain your consent before implementing revisions with respect to such information.

### 12. Chew Contact Information:
