# Frequently Asked Questions

Live streaming can feel overwelming at first, so many new terms to learn and buttons to press. We've put the most common questions here in one place so you can join the hundreds of successful live events as quickly as possible. 

If you have any questions (or queries relating to any of the content found in the Chew Guide), please feel free to [get in touch](http://chew.tv/guide/help_and_support).

## What is live streaming?

Live streaming is the broadcast of live video and audio content over the Internet.

## Why should I live stream my event?

Not everyone can make it to your event in person. Fans are all over the world and it simply costs too much money to fly that far (for most people, yea I know you can afford to skrillex). 

Live streaming lets you connect with potentially vast global audiences in an extremely cost effective way and can take a local event and make it world wide. Bigger than bigger. 

## What is Chew?

Chew is a live streaming platform for DJs, built by DJs.

## How much does Chew cost?

Chew is free to use and free to view! 

## Can I watch Chew streams on a mobile device?

Chew is built to work on any device, anywhere. You can watch streams on your laptop or macbook (with our Flash-based player) or on mobile devices (using our mobile-friendly player).

A browser, is the name given to software that enables you to view internet content like this FAQ page. The most famous examples are Google's Chrome, Apple's Safari and Microsoft's Internet Explorer. keeping your browser and other software up to date will make every website look and run better, including Chew. Giving you the smoothest viewing experience - ahhh yeah.

## Can I offer pay-per-view streams using Chew?

Yes, but this is currently a private Alpha feature. Please [get in touch](http://chew.tv/guide/help_and_support) to find out more.

## Does Chew limit the number of viewers who can watch my streams?

Nope. Chew can handle any number of viewers - so do your worst and break the viewcount record!

## Do I need to worry about copyright issues?

Chew is unlike other live streaming services. We built the platform with rightsholders and copyright owners in mind. We are rights compliant and licensed to the fullest extent possible within the markets we operate in. 

We do, however, take a very dim view of users going out of their way to violate applicable laws. Chew will terminate any account found to be actively breaching applicable laws. 

Please see the [Chew Terms](http://chew.tv/guide/terms) for more.

## How many cameras should I use for my stream?

You can broadcast an audio-only stream through the Chew platform. But for people to see you hands (and feet) in action, you'll need at least one camera for the video feed, but Chew supports multiple cameras if you want that multi angle effect. Be inventive.

Generally, the number of cameras you can stream from is limited by the encoder you're using, your computer's processing power and your hardware.

## What encoder should I use?

Chew works with most encoders on the market. We cater to users with free encoders like [Flash Media Live Encoder](http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/flash-media-encoder.html), through to users with professional broadcast-level [Wirecast](http://www.telestream.net/wirecast/overview.htm) licenses.

If you come across any issues connecting an encoder to the Chew platform, [please get in touch](mailto:support@chew.tv)!

## What type of connection should I use to stream?

While WiFi is often as fast as a wired connection, a wired connection direct to your router is much more reliable. We recommend testing the connection strength before you start setting up; using a tool like [Speedtest.net](http://speedtest.net/).

On mobile, WiFi streaming is recommended over 3G. However, if you have a 4G-enabled phone and strong, consistent signal then 4G may be better than using a shared WiFi connection. Again, check the signal strength before you start streaming using the [Speedtest.net app](http://www.speedtest.net/mobile/).
