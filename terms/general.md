You understand that when using the Chew Service, you will be exposed to Produced Content from a variety of sources, and that Chew is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such Produced Content or other content. You further understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to Produced Content that is inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against Chew with respect to such content.

### **4. Termination; Violations of these Terms**

**Termination by Chew**

If Chew, in its sole discretion, believes that you have breached these Terms, or has reasonable grounds to believe that you are likely to breach these Terms, it may take any action it thinks is necessary to protect Chew, the Chew Service and its Users. Chew may suspend or terminate any account (or any part of it) you may have with Chew or your use of the Chew Service and remove and discard all or any part of your account, user profile, and any Produced Content, at any time. Chew may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing access to the Chew Service, or any part of it (including without limitation all Materials), with or without notice. You agree that any termination or suspension of your access to the Chew Service or any account you may have or portion of it may be effected without prior notice, and you agree that Chew will not be liable to you or any third party for any such termination. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity may be referred by Chew to the appropriate law enforcement authorities. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies Chew may have at law or in equity. 

Chew does not permit copyright infringing activities on the Chew Service, and shall be permitted to terminate access to the Chew Service, and remove any Produced Content or other content submitted by any Users who are found to be repeat infringers. These actions are not limited and Chew may take any other action it reasonably deems appropriate. Chew may, although is under no obligation to, moderate and review Produced Content to ensure it complies with these Terms. Where applicable, should Chew terminate access to the Chew Service for convenience prior to the completion of any particular subscription period, your sole remedy is a pro-rata refund of the purchase price paid for the unavailable service (if any).

Chew may terminate these Terms and close your account at any time on giving you reasonable notice and without responsibility or liability to you if it ceases to provide the Chew Service.

**Termination by You**

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, your only remedy with respect to any dissatisfaction with: (i) the Chew Service; (ii) any provision of these Terms; (iii) any policy or practice of Chew in operating the Chew Service; or (iv) any content or information transmitted through the Chew Service, is to cancel your account and cease use of the Chew Service. You may cancel your account  at any time by discontinuing use of any and all parts of the Chew Service and providing Chew written notice by sending an email to support@chew.tv. Chew may also retain information from accounts disabled for breach of these Terms for up to one year to prevent repeat abuse or other breach of these Terms.  No fees payable (if any) by you in connection with the Chew Service are refundable upon cancellation of  your account by you.

### **5. Copyright infringement notification**

If you are a copyright owner or an agent of a copyright owner (the “**Copyright Owner**”) and believe that any content on the Chew Service infringes your copyrights, you may submit a ‘takedown’ request. This notification of claimed infringement must be a written communication provided to the designated agent of Chew that includes the following information:

1. a physical or electronic signature of a person authorised to act on behalf of the Copyright Owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
2. identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works.
3. identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Chew to locate the material.

5. a statement that the Copyright Owner has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorised by the Copyright Owner, its agent, or the law.
6.  statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorised to act on behalf of the Copyright Owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Chew’s registered designated copyright agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement is: Mr. Wil Benton. His contact information is as follows:

Postal address: Chew Live LTD, 4th Floor, 86-90 Paul Street, London, EC2A 4NE UK.

Email address: takedown@chew.tv

Any notification of claimed infringement that does not comply with the takedown request’s requirements may be invalid.

If you receive notice from Chew that your content has been taken down pursuant to a notification of alleged infringement and believe that this takedown is improper or incorrect, you may provide Chew with a counter notification. To be valid, a counter notification must be a written communication provided to Chew’s designated agent as mentioned above that includes substantially the following:

1. your physical or electronic signature.
2. identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.
3. a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.
4. your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address is outside of the United Kingdom, the jurisdiction of the English courts, and that you will accept service of process from the Copyright Owner who provided notification as mentioned in section 6.1 or an agent of such person.

Finding third party content using the Search Functionality does not, in and of itself, give you any rights whatsoever to use such third party content in any way, and, without limiting the provisions in Section 12 below, you hereby indemnify and hold harmless Chew for any losses or liabilities arising out of your use of the Search Function or third party content.

### **9. Third Party Websites**
