# Getting started with OBS

[Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/) is free and open source software for video recording and live streaming. If you're so inclined, you can find its source code on [github](https://github.com/jp9000/OBS). 

There are two free versions available: 

- OBS for PC [(download)](https://obsproject.com/download)
- OBS for Mac [(download)](https://obsproject.com/download#mac)

OBS has a fairly in-depth [Help](http://jp9000.github.io/OBS), [Support](http://jp9000.github.io/OBS/general/support.html) and [FAQ](http://jp9000.github.io/OBS/general/faq.html) sections on their website - but we'll condense what you need to know.

If you're a Mac user, [**read on**](http://chew.tv/guide/encoder_setup/obs_mac) to get setup.
For PC users, [**head here**](http://chew.tv/guide/encoder_setup/obs_pc) for more info.
