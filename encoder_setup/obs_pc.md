And a huge thank you to [DJ Dead Air](http://twitter.com/djdeadair) for his help in putting the below guide together. 

1. [Download](https://obsproject.com/download), install and open OBS

2. Click the + icon below 'Scenes' to create a scene

3. Click the + icon below 'Sources' to add your video and audio sources. If you're using a webcam and USB audio, this would be adding:

	- Webcam (either USB or laptop webcam) - this will be called **Video Capture Device**
	- Audio input (called **Audio Input Capture** - this may not be needed for some versions of Windows) 

3. Save your input scenes and sources

4. Open **Settings** and then **Broadcast Settings** tab 

6. Set **Mode** to **Live Stream**, then click the **Streaming Service** dropdown and select **Custom**

7. Go to Chew and create (if you haven't done already) [a new Show](http://chew.tv/guide/using_chew/go_live_on_chew)

8. Copy and paste your **Stream URL** into the **FMS URL** and **Stream Name** into **Play Path/Stream Key**

9. Click **OK**

10. Click the **Audio** tab on the left side bar

11. Select your **Primary Sound Driver** in the **Desktop Audio Device** dropdown

12. Select your **Primary Audio Source** in the **Microphone/Auxiliary Audio Device** dropdown

13. Click **Apply** & **Ok**

14. Click **Start Streaming**. Once Chew's detected your signal, you're live! Nice work.
