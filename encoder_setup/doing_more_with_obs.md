# Doing more with OBS

OBS is a truly versatile piece of software. If you've mastered the single camera stream using OBS, here are a few suggestions of what else you can do to make your Shows on Chew a bit more exciting...

##1. Multi-cam 

We think the first step in doing more with OBS is adding a second camera to your broadcast. 

If you're using USB webcams as your main video input; this is as simple as adding an extra webcam to OBS when you [get started](http://chew.tv/guide/encoder_setup/open_broadcast_software). 

If you're using external cameras with video capture cards, you can either add a USB camera to your setup (which is often what we do) or, if you're able to, adding a second camera and capture card. 

A second camera gives your audience the ability to see more of what you're doing during the Show, adding that little bit extra to make your content more engaging for viewers. 

##2. Image overlay

Adding imagery to your OBS broadcast can be as simple as adding a logo to your streams. But you can also add live visualisations, camera templates and more to make your content more visually engaging for your audience. 

You can see what Riglow does with image overlays below:
