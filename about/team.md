# The Team

## Ben Bowler

A drummer from the age of six, Ben started his music and technology career early. He studied technology at school, before leaving college to freelance as a developer. As his interest in electronic music and DJing grew, Ben moved to London to gain invaluable industry experience.

He joined [AEI Media](http://aeimedia.co.uk) as a marketing intern, quickly becoming a key member of the team. During his time with the business, Ben built AEI's live streaming and e-commerce platform. Ben then joined [Vice](http://vice.com) to work on both their ad sales and internal business software.

Ben met Wil in 2013; having previously been a fan of Wil's music, tech and culture blog FatKidOnFire. The duo started working together on what was then a sideline project. With the help of a start-up loan, Chew officially came into being at the start of 2014. The core of a live streaming platform was there, but the duo lacked experience and focus. At the end of the year, Chew joined the [Ignite](http://ignite100.com) accelerator program, giving Ben and Wil the focus and time to refine Chew into what it is now. Since then, Chew has seen a rapid increase in the number of DJs and music fans coming into the community.

Wil moved to London to study Pharmacology at King's College London in 2007. It was there that he started [FatKidOnFire](http://fatkidonfire.com), which earned him the 'Digital Journalist of the Year' title at the 2010 Guardian Student Media Awards. FKOF is now a chart-topping record label, events brand and an award-winning digital publication. 

Having been introduced by a mutual friend, Wil started working with Ben Bowler in 2013. The duo went on to start Chew in early 2014. After finishing the Ignite accelerator programme, Wil and Ben launched the platform in early 2015. To date, they've raised a seed investment round, welcomed nearly 20,000 users to Chew and hired their first employee. 

Wil is known for his rather unnecessary trainer collection, enjoys the odd burger, burrito and whiskey while listening to music that frightens his mother. He also finds time to manage a record label and occasionally DJ (badly).

## Sam Millar

Sam is a 22 year-old computer science graduate with a love for web-development and associated technologies. His interests span the entire stack, from Linux sysadmin to user experience design.

His love for engineering began in 2006 when he registered his first domain for a PHP-based personal website. Since then, Sam's shifted to technologies like AngularJS, Django, Rails, jQuery in conjunction with Linux, SQL, nginx stacks. As a full-stack developer, Sam's interested in the latest technologies - incorporating them into his projects wherever possible.

Sam joined the Chew team straight out of University (where he graduated with a MEng Computer Science degree within ECS at the University of Southampton), moving to London in the summer of 2015. He's been instrumental in the platform's successes since. Sam spends much of his spare time discovering and exploring (mostly electronic) music. He's a keen DJ and is also experimenting with Logic Pro X in the hope of producing his own music someday soon.
