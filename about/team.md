# The Chew Team

## Wil Benton
###Co-Founder & CEO
Wil moved to London to study Pharmacology at King's College London in 2007. It was there that he started [FatKidOnFire](http://fatkidonfire.com), which earned him the 'Digital Journalist of the Year' title at the 2010 Guardian Student Media Awards. Today, FKOF is a chart-topping record label, events brand and an award-winning digital publication. 

Having been introduced by a mutual friend, Wil started working with Ben Bowler in 2013. The duo went on to start Chew in early 2014. After finishing the Ignite accelerator programme, Wil and Ben launched the platform in early 2015. To date, they've raised two investment rounds, welcomed nearly 30,000 users to Chew and hired an awesome team.

Wil is known for his rather unnecessary trainer collection, enjoys the odd burger, burrito and whiskey while listening to [music](http://soundcloud.com/fatkidonfire) that frightens his mother. He also finds time to manage a record label and occasionally DJ.

## Sam Millar
### CTO
Sam is a 23 year-old computer science graduate with a love for web-development and associated technologies. His interests span the entire stack, from Linux sysadmin to user experience design.

His love for engineering began in 2006 when he registered his first domain for a PHP-based personal website. Since then, Sam's shifted to technologies like AngularJS, Django, Rails, jQuery in conjunction with Linux, SQL, nginx stacks. As a full-stack developer, Sam's interested in the latest technologies - incorporating them into his projects wherever possible.

Sam joined the Chew team straight out of University (where he graduated with a MEng Computer Science degree within ECS at the University of Southampton), moving to London in the summer of 2015. He's been instrumental in the platform's successes since. Sam spends much of his spare time discovering and exploring (mostly electronic) music. He's a keen DJ and is also experimenting with Logic Pro X in the hope of producing his own music someday soon.

## Andy Puleston
### Head of Artist Relations
Prior to joining Chew, Andy was the Digital Editor for Music at the BBC. He was responsible for the leadership and delivery of the digital elements of the new BBC Music uber-brand; including BBC Introducing and the major music events coverage from Glastonbury to Radio 1’s Big Weekend.  He also lead the work to conceive the BBC Music Streaming service, as announced in [September 2015](http://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/bbc-takes-on-spotify-and-apple-music-while-helping-them-out/).

Before moving to BBC Music, Andy worked at Radio 1 as the Head of Digital where he was responsible for all of the radio station's digital platforms - including the award-winning [bbc.co.uk/radio1](http://bbc.co.uk/radio1) and the social media portfolio. Andy is a founding member of the [BBC Playlister](http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/dg-playlister.html) service (which became BBC Music) and was instrumental in its conception and development. He enlisted DJs Zane Lowe, Annie Mac, Mary-Anne Hobbs, B Traits, MistaJam, Fearne Cotton and more to help launch the service.  Playlister arrived to critical acclaim and was nominated for both a Webby and a Radio Academy Award. 

He also made the transition into programme making for Radio 1 where he was Executive Producer for the station’s specialist shows including Gilles Peterson, Fabio & Grooverider, Annie Nightingale, The Radio 1 Rock Show, Bobby Friction & Nihal and Huw Stephens.

## Alex Cirino
### Marketing 
Alex is a 22 year old Business Management graduate and techno enthusiast. When he’s not admiring his vinyl collection and playing hypnotic vibes, he leads Chew's marketing and customer success efforts.

During his university degree, Alex launched his own clothing company - a decision which sparked his passion for marketing and all things creative. After spotting an opening to join the Chew team, Alex knew it was something he had to get involved in: the role combined his marketing expertise with his love for both music and DJing.

Outside of music, Alex has a great love for roast chicken sandwiches, all things Romanian and Nina Kraviz. You can catch him DJing weekly on [Chew](https://chew.tv/alex-cirino); experimenting with deep and dark sounds and playing his latest vinyl pickups.

## Ben Bowler
###Co-Founder & Advisor
A drummer from the age of six, Ben started his music and technology career early. He studied technology at school, before leaving college to freelance as a developer. As his interest in electronic music and DJing grew, Ben moved to London to gain invaluable industry experience. He joined [AEI Media](http://aeimedia.co.uk) as a marketing intern, quickly becoming a key member of the team. Ben built AEI's live streaming and e-commerce platform, before joining [Vice](http://vice.com) to work on both their ad sales and internal business software.

Ben and Wil started working together in 2013 on what was then a sideline project. With the help of a startup loan, Chew officially came into being at the start of 2014. At the end of the year, Chew joined the [Ignite](http://ignite.io/) accelerator program, giving the duo the focus and time to refine Chew into what it is now.

While Ben [left Chew](https://blog.chew.tv/moving-on-from-chew-224c236ea8e2#.wptvu2yk7) to focus on other projects in October 2016, he continues to support the team in an Advisory role.
