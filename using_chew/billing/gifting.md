#Gifting

###What is Gifting?
[Gifting](https://chew.tv/gifting) allows your fans to support your shows on Chew. 
Chew's vision is to connect the world's DJs, music producers and personalities with a global audience. We feel helping our users generate income is an important part of that vision!

We are testing gifting with a small group of users and, pending feedback, will roll the feature out to all of our users over the coming months.

For more, information please visit [the Chew community slack](https://slack.chew.tv) **#Gifting** channel!

###What are gifts?
Gifts are virtual goods that have monetary value. Once you've enabled gifting on your channel, other Chew users can buy you these virtual goods. Once someone has bought you a gift, the majority of the gift's value will be deposited into your bank account on a weekly basis – or monthly, if you prefer – via secure payment provider [Stripe](https://stripe.com/about).

The gifts you receive will be visible on your channel, as well as on other places across the site.

###How much money will I earn?
When a user buys you a gift, you will receive all of the money generated from the sale, minus a card transaction fee. The card transaction fee is 2.9% of the gift's value + 30p/30¢ per successful charge.

###How do I receive my earnings?
To receive your Gifting earnings, you must create and connect your Chew account to a Stripe account. Currently, to receive gifts, you'll also need to be in one of the [25 countries Stripe currently operates in](https://stripe.com/global). We will be adding Paypal integration (as well as potentially other payment providers) in the future.

To create a Stripe account (it's free!), you’ll need some details handy, including:

- Your bank's account number & sort code
- Your home address
- Your phone number.

##How do I get started?
