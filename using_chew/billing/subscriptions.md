#Subscriptions

As a subscribing Chew user, you have access to a range of awseome features if you subscribe to one of [our subscription tiers](https:/chew.tv/account/billing). You can find an overview of the awesome features we're building for subscribing users [here](https://trello.com/b/UcS0N2fx/chew-subs-roadmap).

###What are the benefits of subscribing?
Subscribing users have access to longer archive retention, certain privileges across the platform and advanced features that non-subscribing users don't get. 

###What are these awesome features?
The awesome features include stream and audio forwarding, auto-uploads to other streaming platforms, faster archiving, homepage promotion, badass subscriber badges, 4K/ 360 video support and much, much more! 

###Do I have to subscribe?
No, you don't have to be a paying user to use Chew! If you're a creator broadcasting shows on Chew, the main difference between your account and a subscriber's is longer archive retention and the advanced features. What does this mean? Well, subscribers' shows archives for 30 or 90 days (and are publicly playable during those 30 or 90 days) after broadcast. Users who don't subscribe don't get the 30 day archives (or access to the advanced features). 

###What other options do I have? 
If you'd rather just extend the life of your archived shows on Chew, but not purchase a subscription, we also offer a Pay As You Go (PAYG) storage service. PAYG storage allows you to save shows for archiving and purchase storage for your recorded shows at a set cost per hour of content stored per month. 

###How much does it cost?
Subscriptions are £9.99 ('Plus' tier) and £49.99 ('Pro' tier) per month. We also offer annual discounts if you'd like to buy a years' subscription upfront. PAYG storage costs £0.24 per hour of content stored per month. 

###Subscription/ PAYG Info:
- Subscription payments are billed in advance
- Prices listed include VAT at 20%. Non-European users will not be charged fees including VAT
- Your first payment will be charged automatically when you select a subscription (including PAYG storage), once you've added your payment details
- Your subscription will be renewed and payment will be taken automatically at the end of every billing cycle (monthly from the date of your subscription)
- Payment will be taken on the same calendar day each month (unless you change your subscription)
- PAYG storage costs will be billed in arrears for the previous payment period's usage
- The £0.01 monthly cost listed on [the billing page](https://chew.tv/account/billing) charged to check against an active card and allow us to store your payment details on file while we calculate your monthly PAYG storage costs. At the end of your monthly billing cycle, we calculate your PAYG storage bill and deduct the £0.01 against your final monthly bill
- Only saved shows count towards your PAYG storage bill
- Shows must be explicitly saved by you in your [show management page](https://chew.tv/account/shows) in order to become chargeable (this storage will not be charged until a show has exceeded its free retention period, if applicable)
- Saved shows can be unsaved at any time from the same show management page and removed from your PAYG storage bill
- If you unsave a saved show part-way through a monthly billing cycle, or downgrade from PAYG storage, you will still need to pay the PAYG storage costs associated at the end of the next monthly billing cycle
- You can unsubscribe or downgrade your subscription at any time from the billing dashboard (please note you will lose your saved shows if you downgrade to a free user — but you are still able to [download them](https://chew.tv/channel/downloads))
- If you downgrade, you will not be refunded for any charged advanced payment. However, this balance (pro-rated from the amount of the billing cycle remaining) will remain on your account and will be used by any future subscription invoices (if applicable)
- Payments are handled by secure payment provider [Stripe](https://stripe.com/about)
- We will be adding support for other payment provuders (including PayPal) in the future.
