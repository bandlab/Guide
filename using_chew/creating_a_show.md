Once you've logged into your Chew account, you'll land on your [Shows](http://chew.tv/account/shows) page. This is your account homepage and it acts as an archive for all the Shows you've broadcast through Chew. 

From this Shows page, you'll be able to access your (via the links in the header): 

- Account settings
	- Where you can update your account details
- Go Live
	- Where you create a new Show
- Shows page
- Logout.  

# Go Live

If you've clicked on the 'Go Live' or 'New Show' links, Chew will set up a new Show for you to broadcast from. 

We can only use your camera and microphone or line level feed with your permission. Once you've allowed Chew access to these, you're ready to _Go Live_ and start streaming your set! 

- Give your Show a name (or title) or use our auto created one.
	- The name of the show is used in your shows unique URL, so keep your names short and catchy to maximise sharability. 
- Set a start time
	- Great for setting everything up ready. 
	- All shows dated in the future get an automatic count down timer, helping you build suspense for your event, and give something for your fans to watch if they have logged in to watch early.
- Upload a flyer image. 
	- The flyer image acts as a cover photo on facebook for both your Watch page and your dedicated Chew player (before your Show starts). If you don't upload a flyer image, viewers will see the Chew logo default. 
- Give your Show a description. 
	- This description is used on the Watch page and is added to the default share text when fans share your Watch link. 

## Run page

The Run page is private to you. Run pages give you each Show's unique stream information. You can see how many fans are watching right now and... 

From the Run page, you can also view your Show's player (where you can preview what your viewers will see) and the Watch page URL. 

You can engage with your viewers in the Chew Chat box if you want without having to leave the Show's Run page. 

# Watch Page

The public Watch page is where your viewers watch and engage with your stream. 

To get people to see your stream in large numbers you'll need to publicise the Watch page URL (which is displayed on your Show's Run page). Once your viewers have accessed the Watch page, they can view your Show through the Chew player, engage with you and other viewers in the Chew Chat and share the Watch page themselves via the social share functionality.
