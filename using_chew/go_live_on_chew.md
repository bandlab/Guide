# Go Live

If you've clicked on the [Go Live](http://chew.tv/account/show/new) or [New Show](http://chew.tv/account/show/new) links in the menu, you'll create a new Show. As a DJ, producer or creator on Chew, this is where you perform to the world!

The Run page, the page you're now on, is private to you. Only you have access to this. The page is unique to every Show, giving you each Show's unique streaming information - like your [encoder](http://chew.tv/guide/encoder_setup/getting_started) details.

Get started by:
-	Giving your Show a title and set a start time. If you set a start time for a date in the future, the Show will be scheduled and the Chew player will display a countdown timer.
- Uploading a flyer image. This acts as a cover photo on both your Watch page and Chew player (before your Show starts). If you don't upload a flyer image, we use your Channel's cover image. 
- Giving your Show a description. This description is used on the Watch page and in text people see when your Watch link is shared. 

From the Run page, you can view your Show's player (where you can preview what your viewers will see), the Watch page URL and your sharing details. 
You can also chat to your audience in Chew chat - without leaving the Show's Run page!

# Watch Page

The public Watch page is where your audience watches your Show.

You'll need to share the Watch page URL (which is displayed on your Show's Run page) so your audience knows you've Gone Live. 
Once your viewers have clicked your Watch page URL, they'll be able to view your Show, talk to you and other viewers in the Chew Chat and share the Watch page themselves.

# Setting up your encoder

Once you've created your Show, you'll need to setup your encoder to Go Live. [_Click here to find out how_](http://chew.tv/guide/encoder_setup/open_broadcast_software.md).
