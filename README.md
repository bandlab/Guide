# Chew Guide to Live Streaming

## About Chew

With [Chew](http://chew.tv/guideabout/index), you can broadcast your DJ set, production session - or more - to a global audience. And it takes seconds to get started!

## About the Chew Guide

The Chew Guide will help you get started on the Chew platform - as well as helping you create your first Show, choose your streaming kit and set up an encoder. To make things easier, everything in the Guide is split into 4 categories. You can read up on as little or as much as you need to get started on the Chew platform!

## Open Source

There's a tonne of information available online to learn about live streaming. 

In some cases, we've found this information isn't always correct or as useful as it could be. We've been streaming events for a good few years and think it's time to start sharing the knowledge gained - without limitations or bias. 

With the exception of pages that describe the [Chew platform](http://chew.tv/guide/using_chew/getting_started) and our [developer API](http://chew.tv/guide/developer_api/getting_started), feel free to submit issues and pull requests for review!
